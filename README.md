# Horiseon-Homework
This was our first homework challenge of the course.
We were asked to look at the starter code we were given.
We had to identify and fix any issues in the code.
We also needed to clean up the code and make it easier to read while having the webpage still be functional.
It needed to remain identical to the following screenshot once finsihed.
