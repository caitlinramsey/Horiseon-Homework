# Horiseon Homepage

## Description
This was our first homework challenge of the UNC full stack developer course. We were asked to look at the starter code we were given. We had to identify and fix any issues/bugs in the code. We also needed to clean up the code and make it easier to read while having the webpage still be functional. We needed to make a webpage that was consistent with accessibility standards. The finished product needed to remain identical, yet functional and accessible, to the following screenshot once finished.
